/*
 * CONSOLE REDUCED-MOTION POLICY — the console-facing reduced-motion helpers
 * (foundation layer; CONSOLE_FOUNDATION.md §5).
 *
 * The reactive SOURCE is now shared fork-wide: `src/client/utils/reducedMotion`
 * (VueUse `usePreferredReducedMotion` behind `createGlobalState` — ONE
 * MediaQueryList listener, live). This module re-exposes it under the console
 * names and adds the console MOTION-DURATION policy on top; it no longer owns a
 * second matchMedia subscription.
 *
 * Contract (matches the motion system, motionTokens.ts): `--motion-scale` /
 * `motionMs()` own SPEED; reduced-motion is a SEPARATE OVERRIDING axis — when
 * reduced, motion-heavy effects switch to their short/static variant, not
 * merely play faster. `consoleMotionMs` encodes the default policy: scaled
 * duration normally, a short fixed cap when reduced (mirrors the 480ms
 * convention of energyConversionModel).
