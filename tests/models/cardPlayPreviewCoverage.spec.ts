/**
 * In-scope PROJECT cards whose `bespokePlay` produces an on-play CHOICE that is
 * intentionally NOT pre-collected in the play modal — it rides the post-batch
 * follow-up routing instead. Each entry documents WHY.
 *
 *  - 'follow-up': the on-play CHOICE is INHERENTLY a board/colony interaction OR
 *    renders BETTER on a dedicated premium follow-up surface than crammed into the
 *    play modal (board-tile placement → PlacementBanner; colony placement →
 *    ColoniesOverlay; multi-select card pick → CardSelectionContent; a nested /
 *    composed OrOptions → ModernOptionPicker). The play modal shows the card +
 *    payment; the choice arrives as the rich follow-up.
 *
 *  - 'automatic' (RESERVED, currently NONE): a card whose on-play effect has
 *    GENUINELY nothing showable AND no choice. The refined criterion is the point
 *    of this whole mechanism: **a FIXED, COMPUTABLE result MUST be shown** — even
 *    with no choice, the play modal has to surface the change (M€ / production / TR
 *    / draw / card-resource) as a `current → resulting` chip via a `cardPlayPreview`
 *    hook, so the player never plays blind ("показывать изменение заранее"). So a
 *    "no choice" card is NOT automatically a dynamic fallback — it's a dynamic
 *    fallback only if the result also can't be computed/shown read-only (a variable
 *    bundle that resists a single chip → classify it 'follow-up' and let the
 *    follow-ups speak instead). Today every previously-'automatic' card either got a
 *    result chip (Interplanetary Trade, Media Archives, Terraforming Ganymede, Io
 *    Sulphur Research, Community Services, Quantum Communications, Decomposers) or is
 *    a 'follow-up' (Mars Nomads board placement, Productive Outpost colony bonuses).
 *
 * A card with a declarative `behavior` OR a co-located `cardPlayPreview` hook is
 * covered WITHOUT being listed here. This list keeps the "rides the dynamic
 * fallback" decision EXPLICIT, so a NEW bespoke-play card can't silently slip
 * through without either a hook or a deliberate entry.
